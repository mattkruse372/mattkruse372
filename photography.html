              <h1>Why I love Photograhy (and Art)</h1>
              <p>I love photography because it is able to show the people who view them an inside to the photographer's life. It allows the individual to show others what their life is like without actual words, which I find very interesting. This is why I have incorperated photography into my life, so I would be able to show other people what my viewpoints are and what my life is like to others. I love being able to show other people what I see with my own eyes, in the best way I know how. I love aty for the same reason, because it allows someone to show the insides of their life without using actual words. However, I prefer photography because I have very little art skills so I choose to take photos instead. </p>

                <h1>Some of my Favorite Photos to Take</h1>
                <p>Some photos I love to take are nature landscapes and up close. I love taking photos of the beach of animals and plants that I find, I also love taking photos of the sunrise or sunset. One of my favorite photos that I have taken is of a dandelion during the sunset. It was an upclose photo and I was able to show the individual white stems on it with every little detail. I also remember taking a photo of the water with it looking very clear that day. I was able to show the details of the rocks and the water and it made me happy. One of my favorite things I love about photography too is the editing process. I love being able to show myself through the edits, and i believe that is what makes every photpgrapher unique; the editing process and how at which they do it. Personally, I use Adobe lightroom to edit my photos and occasionally will use Photoshop as well. However, I am not the most experienced with Photoshop so I do not use it that often. I am currently trying to work on portrait and moving photography because I have not had much practice. This is a skill I will try to teach myself this summer because I would like to be able to take photos for the athletic teams at the University at Buffalo, as well as being able to take portraits and maybe earn sort of an income out of what I like to do.  </p>
