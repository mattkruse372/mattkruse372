          <h1>My Career Goal (as of now)</h1>
          <p> Afrer I graduate university, with as of now what I plan to be a bachelor's
            in mechanical engineering, I plan on working as an engineer in nuclear power or renewable energy.
            I would love to work with hydro or nuclear power, specifically fusion, and discover new sources
            of energy for the world. I would love to work alongside other professionals and be able to assist in the design for alternative energy sources and help protect the environment. I find these focuses really interesting and would love if I can be involved in the growth and advancement of the field.    </p>

        <h1>My Next Steps as a High School Student</h1>
        <p>As of now, I plan on attending undergrad at the University At Buffalo
            pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. I am supposed to be joining
            SEDS, or the "students for the exploration and development of space."
            This is very interesting for me because I have found space interesting since
            I was a kid and would love to learn more about it. The club,
            from what I was able to find, promotes space research and exploration
            by having a student-designed rocket that is launched in New Mexico. Last year, they were
            able to lift off about 10,000 feet, but when I spoke to them earlier this year, they said their
            goal for the next year is to reach approximately 30,000 feet.
            At this event, major space exploration companies,
            such as NASA and Space X are there as well.
            This is a great way for me to network,
            and potentially land (pun intended) a job or an internship. This organization will also
            teach me major engineering concepts that will help me in my classes. Hopefully this also
            will be able to help me decide whether or not I would like to go into aerospace engineering,
            which has been something I have been debating on.   </p>
